// An easy Java project that implements a number guessing game. The user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and counts the number of attempts. The user can choose to play again after each game.

import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Project {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Random random = new Random();
        boolean playAgain = true;

        System.out.println("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!");

        while (playAgain) {
            int numberToGuess = random.nextInt(100) + 1;
            int numberOfTries = 0;
            int guess = 0;

            System.out.println("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.");

            while (guess != numberToGuess) {
                System.out.print("Enter your guess: ");
                guess = scanner.nextInt();
                numberOfTries++;

                if (guess < numberToGuess) {
                    System.out.println("Too low. Try again.");
                } else if (guess > numberToGuess) {
                    System.out.println("Too high. Try again.");
                } else {
                    System.out.println("Correct! You guessed the number in " + numberOfTries + " attempts.");
                }
            }

            System.out.print("Would you like to play again? (yes/no): ");
            scanner.nextLine();
            String response = scanner.nextLine().trim().toLowerCase();
            playAgain = response.equals("yes");
        }

        System.out.println("Thank you for playing!");
        scanner.close();
